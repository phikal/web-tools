# `.doc`

Don't worry -- this page isn't a collection of `.doc` files. But it _is_ a
collection of documents, for the most part encoded in the
[PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) file format, but maybe also as a DjVU
or Postscript file. 

My intentions are similar to the [_Gallery_](../gal) section. I wish to gather
and share various documents of whatever subject I am allowed to share and
republish. 

So without further ado, I present my documents.
