Over the years I have gathered many pictures, images and other graphical content
from all over the web. Probably one reason for this was the experience of having
no images, nothing to look at, nothing to share, nothing to collect - a
miserable experience. Therefore I commit this section of this site to exhibiting
my _spoils and loot_ from over the years of most certainly not wasted time.

Additionally, I will be using the opportunity to sort, categorise and clean up
my collection of, probably for the most part nonsensical _data_ (about 18 GB).

Each of the following categories will link to one or more subsections, each page
containing a list of black-and-white thumbnails, to make loading the page
easier. By clicking on a thumbnail, you will be sent to the actual image, which
in turn should be optimised. If available or I know anything specific about an
image, I shall add a comment below.

this page (and on all other sections of my website) **is in the public domain**.
