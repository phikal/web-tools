# Rough orientation

I host various content on this site. Source code, PDFs, Images, texts, lists of
links, etc. Some of these are more personal than others, but nothing is secret.
Use the side bar (or the navigation list on the top of the screen if you're
on a mobile device) to see what I've got here.

Emacs users might be interested in my [`.emacs.d`](./emacs.d.html).
